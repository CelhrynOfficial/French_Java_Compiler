# French Java Compiler (Compilateur Java en Français)

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a **Java compiler entirely in French**. Originally started as a joke proposed by a friend, it has since evolved into a more serious and ambitious endeavor. The goal is to provide a compiler that allows developers to write and compile Java code using **French keywords** and syntax.

## Why?

At first, the idea was just for fun—imagine writing Java code in French! But as the project developed, it became an interesting challenge to see if we could build a tool that helps non-English speakers or just those who want to explore coding in their native language. Plus, it's a great way to have some fun while learning about compilers and language design.

## Current Status

The project is still in its early stages, but we're making steady progress. The plan is to support:
- Basic syntax in French (e.g., `si` instead of `if`, `pour` instead of `for`)
- Error messages and compiler feedback in French
- A simple user interface to run the compiler

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to turn this joke into a working tool!
